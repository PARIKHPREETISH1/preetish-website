Hey, I’m Preetish!
I’m all about building products that drive growth, retention, and real impact—leveraging data, experimentation, and strategy to make it happen. With a background in IT and a Master’s in Business Analytics, I love solving high-impact problems at the intersection of business, technology, and data.

1. Boosted retention by 15% and cut churn by 5% by rolling out personalized experiences like LUZO Cash and tailored service packages.
2. Helped drive 40% business growth through market expansion, strategic partnerships, and unlocking new revenue streams.
3. Launched in-app marketing campaigns and built pricing analytics dashboards to enhance both user experience and business impact.

Beyond work, I’m always exploring startups, AI, and ed-tech, looking for ways tech can make learning more accessible and engaging. If you’re into product, growth, or analytics, let’s connect—I’m always up for great conversations!
